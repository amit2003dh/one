## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn UI** for professional design
- **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **Theme Provider** for dark mode support

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **node-imap** for persistent IMAP connections with IDLE mode
- **Elasticsearch** client for advanced search
- **OpenAI GPT-5** API for AI categorization
- **Axios** for webhook integrations
- In-memory storage with full CRUD operations

### Data Model
- **EmailAccount**: IMAP credentials and connection info
- **Email**: Complete email data with AI category
- **EmailWithAccount**: Extended type for frontend display

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- (Optional) Docker for Elasticsearch
- IMAP email account credentials

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                    # OpenAI API key for AI categorization
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...  # Slack incoming webhook
WEBHOOK_SITE_URL=https://webhook.site/...      # External webhook for automation
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200        # Optional: Elasticsearch URL
```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the server** (already configured):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Set up Elasticsearch** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # See ELASTICSEARCH_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
   docker run -d \
     --name elasticsearch \
     -p 9200:9200 \
     -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
     -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
     docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.11.0
   ```

3. **Add an email account**:
   - Click the "+" button in the sidebar
   - Enter your IMAP credentials
   - The system will start syncing immediately

### IMAP Configuration Examples

**Gmail:**
- IMAP Host: `imap.gmail.com`
- IMAP Port: `993`
- Username: Your Gmail address
- Password: App Password (not your regular password)
- [How to create Gmail App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
- IMAP Host: `outlook.office365.com`
- IMAP Port: `993`
- Username: Your email address
- Password: Your account password

**Yahoo:**
- IMAP Host: `imap.mail.yahoo.com`
- IMAP Port: `993`
- Username: Your Yahoo email
- Password: App Password

## üé® Design System

The application follows a professional email client design inspired by Linear and Superhuman:

- **Colors**: Professional blue primary with category-specific accent colors
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for technical details
- **Layout**: Information-dense three-column layout optimized for email management
- **Category Colors**:
  - üü¢ Interested: Green (#26A641)
  - üîµ Meeting Booked: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - ‚ö™ Not Interested: Gray (#999999)
  - üî¥ Spam: Red (#DC2626)
  - üü° Out of Office: Amber (#F59E0B)

## üìä API Endpoints

### Email Accounts
- `GET /api/accounts` - List all accounts
- `POST /api/accounts` - Add new account
- `DELETE /api/accounts/:id` - Remove account

### Emails
- `GET /api/emails` - List/search emails with filters
- `GET /api/emails/:id` - Get single email
- `PATCH /api/emails/:id/category` - Update category
- `PATCH /api/emails/:id/read` - Mark as read

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` - Check service status

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Real-Time IMAP Synchronization
- Uses IDLE mode for push notifications instead of polling
- Maintains persistent connections with automatic reconnection
- Processes emails in batches to avoid overwhelming the system
- Gracefully handles connection errors and timeouts

### AI Categorization
- GPT-5 model with structured JSON output
- Context-aware classification based on subject, body, and sender
- Confidence scoring for categorization quality
- Immediate notification on "Interested" categorization

### Search Implementation
- Elasticsearch provides full-text search with fuzzy matching
- In-memory fallback ensures search always works
- Filters apply consistently across both search backends
- Results sorted by received date (newest first)

### Error Handling
- Graceful Elasticsearch fallback
- Proper IMAP error recovery
- Silent webhook failures (logs but doesn't break flow)
- User-friendly error messages in UI

## üìù Development Notes

### Storage
- Currently uses in-memory storage (MemStorage)
- Ready for PostgreSQL migration (schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`)
- All storage operations are async for easy database integration

### Security Considerations
- IMAP passwords stored in memory (encrypt for production)
- API secrets managed via environment variables
- No authentication layer (add for production use)

### Performance
- Email list limited to 100 most recent emails
- IMAP fetch batched to last 100 UIDs
- Elasticsearch results capped at 100 documents
- Efficient React Query caching minimizes API calls

## üéØ Testing with Postman

All backend features can be tested via Postman:

1. **Add Account**: `POST /api/accounts` with IMAP credentials
2. **List Emails**: `GET /api/emails?folder=INBOX`
3. **Search**: `GET /api/emails?query=meeting&category=Interested`
4. **Categorize**: `PATCH /api/emails/:id/category` with category body

## üöÄ Next Phase Features (Not in MVP)

- **AI-Powered Suggested Replies** using RAG with vector database
- Email composition and reply functionality
- Thread grouping and conversation view
- Bulk actions (mark multiple as read, delete, categorize)
- Analytics dashboard with email categorization statistics
- PostgreSQL database for production persistence
- User authentication and multi-user support
